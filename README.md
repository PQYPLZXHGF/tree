Tree
=============

![tree](http://inconvergent.net/img/tree_c.jpg "tree")

One of the first attempts I made at generative algorithms was a copy of this
(http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/treeGarden/) great little
application. Recently I decided it was about time that I revisited this
project. As opposed to the algorithm in the link, my trees are generated pixel
by pixel. That is, there are no pre-drawn parts.

As you can see, if you examine the results a little, the trees take shapes that
er neither realistic nor possible. Yet they look very much like trees at first
glance.

## Prerequisites

In order for this code to run you must first download and install:

*    `fn`: https://github.com/inconvergent/fn-python3 (used to generate
     filenames. you can avoid this by editing the main file you are running.)
*    `iutils`: https://github.com/inconvergent/iutils
*    `fast sand paint`: https://github.com/inconvergent/fast-sand-paint (only `main_sand.py`)

## Other Dependencies

The code also depends on:

*    `numpy`
*    `scipy`
